dnsmos - emotion & languages - 4 to 
https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos/blob/main/CONDITIONING_README.md#dnsmos_ovrl
Set to 4.0 for very clean and neutral English speech

Specifies the max frequency of the audio. For best results select 22050 or 24000 as these correspond to 44.1 and 48KHz audio respectively.

https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos/blob/main/CONDITIONING_README.md#vqscore_8
A good value for our model is 0.78 for high-quality speech.
